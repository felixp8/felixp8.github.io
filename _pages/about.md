I am currently a research intern in the Machine Learning in Science group at Uni Tübingen led by Jakob Macke. I was previously a student at Georgia Tech, where I worked in Chethan Pandarinath's lab.

In my free time I like watching cat videos, looking at cat pictures, reading cat stories, listening to cat sounds, and eating and sleeping.
